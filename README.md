# OPEN AI Beackend Server using NodeJS / Docker

## TO DO

- set-up docker containers to run open AI backend server using NodeJS and ENV variables passed in through docker
- set-up Express server POST route for contacing OpenAi API with CORS settings to allow access.
- protect route using tokens stored as cookie in browser of frontend app - for now hard code tokens rather than have an auth flow.
- setup caching using REDIS to store previosuly asked questions.
